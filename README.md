- **Express.js**: Web framework for building server-side logic
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **Passport.js**: Authentication middleware
- **Cloudinary**: Image storage and management
- **Mapbox**: Interactive map integration
- **Connect Flash**: Flash messages for user notifications
- **Connect Mongo**: Session storage with MongoDB
- **Cookie Parser**: Parsing and managing cookies
- **Dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **EJS**: Template rendering engine
- **Express Session**: Session handling middleware
- **Joi**: Data validation library
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling for Node.js
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads
- **Passport Local**: Local strategy for authentication
- **Passport Local Mongoose**: Simplified integration of Passport.js with Mongoose

## 🌟 Key Features
- **🧑‍💻 User Authentication**: Secure login, logout, and user profile management
- **🏠 CRUD Operations**: Add, edit, and delete property listings
- **⭐ Review System**: Add and delete user reviews on listings
- **🔑 Account Management**: Update user account details and change passwords
- **🔐 User Data Security**: Password hashing and encryption for secure data management
